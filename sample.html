<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news. It can take various forms, including fabricated stories, deceptive headlines, manipulated images or videos, and misinformation spread through social media platforms and other online channels.</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">The story of computers goes way back, with tons of cool inventions and ideas that helped make them what they are today. It all started with simple gadgets meant to help with math problems, but now we've got super fancy machines that do all sorts of amazing stuff! Let's take a peek at how it all went down.</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">In 1822, the father of computers, Charles Babbage began developing what would be the first mechanical computer. And then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical Engine which was a general-purpose computer. It contained an ALU, some basic flow chart principles and the concept of integrated memory.</p>

<p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">1st Generation: This was from the period of 1940 to 1955. This was when machine language was developed for the use of computers. They used vacuum tubes for the circuitry. For the purpose of memory, they used magnetic drums. These machines were complicated, large, and expensive. They were mostly reliant on batch operating systems and punch cards. As output and input devices, magnetic tape and paper tape were implemented. For example, ENIAC, UNIVAC-1, EDVAC, and so on.
  <p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;"> 2nd Generation: The years 1957-1963 were referred to as the “second generation of computers” at the time. In second-generation computers, COBOL and FORTRAN are employed as assembly languages and programming languages. Here they advanced from vacuum tubes to transistors. This made the computers smaller, faster and more energy-efficient. And they advanced from binary to assembly languages. For instance, IBM 1620, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and so forth. </p>
  <p style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">3rd Generation: The hallmark of this period (1964-1971) was the development of the integrated circuit.  A single integrated circuit (IC) is made up of many transistors, which increases the power of a computer while simultaneously lowering its cost. These computers were quicker, smaller, more reliable, and less expensive than their predecessors. High-level programming languages such as FORTRON-II to IV, COBOL, and PASCAL PL/1 were utilized. For example, the IBM-360 series, the Honeywell-6000 series, and the IBM-370/168. </p>
